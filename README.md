# Code academy
This is my project that was created through SQL,
and is transferred to Python\
through SQLAlchemy.

Before using commands, it is strongly
recommended to make help on them.

# Commands:

## help:

```bash
python -m academy.main --help
```

## add new staff(it's just example, you can change the values)
```bash
python -m academy.main --new-staff 'Employee' 23 'Male' 'Manager' 'employee@mail.ru' '20/02/2001' '03/02/2020' 20
```
